            <h2>What we stand for </h2>
            <p>
            Here at Treasure Trash, we want to inspire people to change the world for the better. We want to encourage and challenge people to partake in helping the environment. What sets us apart from other app developers is our passion, curiosity, and care for the world and its future. Therefore helping to create a better tomorrow. It’s not just about what we do but how we do, creating this app and inspiring people of all ages to encourage one another to help pick up trash from both the streets and around the water areas. This way we create a special and unique culture that hopefully follows the next generation as well, and we are able to bring out the best in people. One of our goals is to ultimately expand outside of Norway and help people around the world, especially in low-income countries where this is a big problem.

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>The situation we face today regarding littering is a challenge. Littering is not only bad for the environment and animals but also people. Animals like turtles, fish, and birds often mistake plastic for food. That can create a problem in the digestive system, ultimately making it impossible for them to digest real food and die of starvation. Trash also contains chemicals that can poison and cause damages to their organs. Not only is it a problem if they eat it, but it is also a problem when they get stuck in them. In that way, they can get strangled, starve, or drown. It is also common to see trash in places like the beach, where you can step on a sharp object by accident. Trash also makes both the city and the beach look dirty, this way people will not come and visit those places moreover it becomes an economical problem. The reason we chose this goal was so we could encourage people to help make the earth a safer and cleaner place to live. This can be done by doing simple tasks like picking up trash. This app will help you feel like you are getting a reward for saving the planet.</p>

            <h2>Life on land and life bellow water</h2>
            <p>
            As mentioned before littering is often caused by humans laziness, and can potentially have an mortal effect on wildlife. 
            Littering can also change wildlife on land and below water habitats and environments. Here are some examples of what animals may endure due to littering: 
            </p>

            <ul>

            

	            <li class="li_section6">1. Animals being strangled by plastic bags and other litter</li>
	            <li class="li_section6">2. Wildlife eating trash thinking its food</li>
	            <li class="li_section6">3. Littering destroying animals nests</li>
                <li class="li_section6">4. Wildlife getting tangled up in trash</li>
            
            </ul>
            <p>
            For us these everyday objects seem to be harmless, but tend to be detrimental to animals wellbeing. 
            Therefore we should not let our carelessness contribute to this crisis.
            Beyond that littering can permanently change an ecosystem for the worse. 
            The harm can include less biodiversity, damaged habitats and decreased resilience. The most serious consequence of littering is the loss of biodiversity. 
            Loss of biodiversity does not only lead to serious effects on wildlife's  ecosystems and food chains. 
            It also leads to monetary loss, food insecurity, more extreme weather and less jobs. 
            Littering has proven itself to be a cancer that effects all living creatures. Fortunately it is a preventable disease that all humans can prevent.
