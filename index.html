					<p><img class="bilde1" src="Pictures/forsidetrash.jpg">We present to you the app Treasure Trash. The app that makes what usually is a boring task fun

            Easily explained our app is an app that rewards its users for picking up trash off the streets. It will incentivize people to do some voluntary work for the betterment of our planet. Not only are they contributing in the fight to end littering, plastic pollution and global warming, but they will receive a little treasure in return for the trash. 
            
            The rewards users can get rewarded are coupons, discounts and so forth.</p>

                  <h1>EFFECTS OF LITTERING</h1>
                        <p>The waste in the world is slowly increasing, if we donâ€™t handle this it will affect our health and environment. According to worldbank.org waste management is a universal problem that affects every single person in the world, therefore everyone must help to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Waste that is dumped harms humans, hurts the environment, and hinders economic growth in rich and poor countries. All this waste also affects the ocean. It clogs drains that cause flooding, transmits diseases, and harms animals that consume this waste unknowingly. Plastic waste that happens to get into the ocean in 2016 alone was around 242 million tonnes.</p>

                      <p>Above the more broad effects of littering were mentioned, but there are many incidents which have led to death. Both wildlife on land and below water have died due to consumption of plastic.
                        One of the most common causes of littering is laziness and carelessness. Especially in more developed countries where there are plenty of public trash cans. 
                        Humans carelessness has an direct and mortal effect on wildlife. 
                        That is one of the reasons why we hope our app will encourage more people to pick up trash, and prevent unnecessary deaths. 
                        When making the app we also had in mind some of The UNs sustainable development goals. We believe our app can have noticeable effect in reaching goal 13 and goal 14.</p>
