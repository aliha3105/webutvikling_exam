                We present to you the app Treasure Trash. The app that makes what usually is a boring task fun

                Easily explained our app is an app that rewards its users for picking up trash off the streets. It will incentivize people to do some voluntary work for the betterment of our planet. Not only are they contributing in the fight to end littering, plastic pollution and global warming, but they will receive a little treasure in return for the trash.

                The rewards users can get rewarded are coupons, discounts and so forth.

            <h1>EFFECTS OF LITTERING</h1>
            <p>Littering is a problem that most countries have to deal with, and the effect this has on nature is essential. The plastic waste that makes it to the water area is an issue we have had to deal with for a long time, as reported by The World Wide Fund for Nature there is around 1.5 million tons of plastic waste from the water bottling industry alone. The trash also clogs up the streets, sewers, rivers, and fields, which can both be bad for the environment and the economy. Animals get especially hurt by this, causing them to get sick and even die, which slowly makes it to humans through the life cycle. </p>

                Above the more broad effects of littering were mentioned, but there are many incidents which have led to death. Both wildlife on land and below water have died due to consumption of plastic.
                One of the most common causes of littering is laziness and carelessness. Especially in more developed countries where there are plenty of public trash cans.
                Humans carelessness has an direct and mortal effect on wildlife.
                That is one of the reasons why we hope our app will encourage more people to pick up trash, and prevent unnecessary deaths.
                When making the app we also had in mind some of The UNs sustainable development goals. We believe our app can have noticeable effect in reaching <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13"target="_blank" >Goal 13</a> and <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14" target="_blank">Goal 14</a>.
